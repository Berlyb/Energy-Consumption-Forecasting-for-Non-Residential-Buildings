# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-for-Non-Residential-Buildings

This project aims to analyze and predict electricity consumption patterns across diverse non-residential buildings using a robust dataset derived from the Building Data Genome Project 2. By leveraging advanced predictive modeling techniques, the project delivers actionable insights that support energy optimization, cost reduction, and sustainability efforts.
